      <h2>What We Did</h2>
      <div class='text' style='margin-top: 10;'>
        Bespoken and DefinedCrowd ran this benchmark to measure the Automatic Speech Recognition Performance of three new players in the Digital Contact Center space:
        <ul>
          <li>Amazon Connect</li>
          <li>Google Dialogflow</li>
          <li>Twilio Voice</li>
        </ul>
        We used datasets in US English and Spanish to see how well they performed against challenging, real-world data.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class='col-12'>
      <h2>What It Means</h2>
      <div class='text' style='margin-top: 10'>
        The results speak for themselves - these are tough scenarios, and they demonstrate that Speech Recognition, despite what you may read, is far from a solved problem.

        It's critical to thorughly evaluate vendors before making a decision - DefinedCrowd and Bespoken can help.

      <h2>Word Error Rate By Platform - English</h2>
      <div>
        {{> ivr/wordErrorRateByPlatformEnglish }}
      </div>
      <div class='caption'>
        We see here significant variation between platforms. 
        And the Word Error Rates are high - these are tough, real-world scenarios, the type customers are in everyday:
        pauses and hesitations, background noise, spotty connections, poor enunciation, etc.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-12' >
      <h2>Word Error Rate By Platform - Spanish</h2>
      <div>
        {{> ivr/wordErrorRateByPlatformSpanish }}
      </div>
      <div class='caption'>
        Interestingly, on Spanish we see the performance almost exactly inverted. 
        This is not particularly surprising, as there are significant variations within platforms between support for languages and locales.
        That means that because a platform does well with one language and locale does NOT mean it will excel at others. Testing, with real data, is the key to find the right solution.

      <h2>Word Error Rate By Domain</h2>
      <div>
        {{> ivr/wordErrorRateByDomain }}
      </div>
      <div class='caption'>
        Similar to the significant variations we see by language, we see the same based on the industry and domain we are working within.
        ASR systems will bias towards the domains they know best and have been trained on most intensively.
        So if your provider has not been trained and tuned for your specific domain, your performance will be negatively impacted, and vice-versa.

      <h2>Word Error Rate By Background Noise</h2>
      <div>
        {{> ivr/wordErrorRateByNoisy }}
      </div>
      <div class='caption'>
        As mentioned at the outset - these are tough, real-world scenarios. 
        Background noise really challenges speech recognition systems - and we can see reflected here how dramatic the impact is on it.<br>

      <h2>Word Error Rate By Ethnicity</h2>
      <div>
        {{> ivr/wordErrorRateByEthnicity }}
      </div>
      <div class='caption'>
        Also unsurprising - race and ethnicity have a big impact as well. 
        Between white and non-white speakers, we see non-white speakers being understood significantly worse, almost dramatically so in scenarios.

      <h2>Word Error Rate By Age Group</h2>
      <div>
        {{> ivr/wordErrorRateByAgeGroup }}
      </div>
      <div class='caption'>
        We see less of an impact by age - this is an area that represents significant progress for ASR/NLP platforms.
        This is good news and shows how these systems have evolved over time to better serve real-world scenarios.
      </div>

      <h2>Word Error Rate By Gender</h2>
      <div>
        {{> ivr/wordErrorRateByGender }}
      </div>
      <div class='caption'>
        The impact by gender is also minimal - this is also good news.
        Historically, this has been a challenge for ASR/IVR systems - it's critical to ensure that your ENTIRE audience has a great experience.
